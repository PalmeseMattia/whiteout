# Chronos

Chronos is an open source, web based, white noise generator. It uses [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to ensure compatibility with most browsers.

## Roadmap
- Implement audioWorklet to generate noise
- Let the user generate his own mixers
- Add the ability to share your configuration
- Refactoring

## Run locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
#or any other package manager of your choice
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Or build the project:

```bash

```
